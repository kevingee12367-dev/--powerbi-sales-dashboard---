Project Overview

This project analyzes e‑commerce sales performance using Power BI. The goal is to demonstrate junior data analyst skills across data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and business insight generation.
The dashboard highlights key revenue drivers, customer behavior, product performance, and time‑based trends.
This project is part of my data analytics portfolio and showcases my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights.

Lowest Category: Home Decor — $151,000
Key Findings
- Books is the highest‑revenue category, generating $192K.
- It outperforms Electronics by about 6%, showing a competitive top tier.
- The top three categories account for a large share of total revenue, indicating strong concentration.
- Home Decor underperforms significantly, trailing Books by $41K and Electronics by $30K.
- Overall, revenue is top‑heavy, suggesting opportunities to improve product strategy and marketing for lower‑performing categories.
